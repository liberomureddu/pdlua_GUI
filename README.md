# pdlua_GUI
Here you'll find some GUI objects I made with pdlua. The idea is to create enough of them to make control surfaces similar as what can be done with TouchOSC, Open Stage Control, etc.

Here's the main reference I used for making these objects: https://agraef.github.io/pd-lua/tutorial/pd-lua-intro.html

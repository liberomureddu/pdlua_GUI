# Pdlua Control Surface Objects
A collection of GUI objects suitable to create custom control surfaces made with pdlua. They are currently at version 0.1.0, hence a very initial state.

## Documentation
Open the patch 'pdlua_control_surface_objects_0.1.0_OVERVIEW.pd' for an overview of all the available objects.

I used this [Pdlua tutorial](https://agraef.github.io/pd-lua/tutorial/pd-lua-intro.html) as the main reference.
